I'm following a short little course on Udemy
named Ansible for the Absolute Beginner - DevOps


I'll set up a Linux ec2 instance on my aws account
(I guess I could terraform it... ðŸ˜„)

and look up how to install ansible and see how I do.

Wish me luck!

I started up an ec2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023 AMI 2023.4.20240319.1 x86_64 HVM kernel-6.1) and found this article:

```udo yum update -y

sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y ansible

ansible â€” version

sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

[your-group]
your-ec2-instance-ip-address
```
